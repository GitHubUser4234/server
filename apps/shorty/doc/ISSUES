This is a short list of known issues:

- The datepicker popup in the edit dialog fails to set the expiration date: 
I have no idea what the problem is. Exactly the same object works flawlessly
in the dialog to create a new shorty. I can't see any difference, except in
the edit dialog the date is taken from the existing row entry (working fine).
Maybe there is some sort of magic spell to awake a datepicker after changing
its date value ? No idea...

- Clicking on a source or relay url from within the sharing dialog updates the
clicks counter and access time correctly, but the shown list entry is not
updated accordingly. 

- Shorty does not work in the konqueror web browser
All appears to be working fine except for one annoying thing:
the standalone dialogs won't open ! (show, create and edit entries)
Therefore Shorty is currently more or less useless in this browser.

- Shorty does not work in the rekonq web browser
The basic navigation elements (menu left) work, but the desktop stays empty.
Apparently no script is executed, an issue with the js document.ready event.

- It appears there is an issue with setting opacity in the Safari browser:
The status filter in the lists toolbar shows an ugly black brick instead of a
dimmed icon overlay. Also some other style issues appear, but the plugin seems
to be completely usable.

- When internally validating the setup of the base url used in the static
backend you get a false positive ("doesn't work") although things are fine, if
the mapping of base url to shorty plugin is done via a redirect. This is for
exaple the case if you implement the mapping on a remote server because you
want to use a different domain name for statically shortened urls.
The reason is that jqueries ajax calls won't handle redirects internally. A
wrapper will have to be implemented.
